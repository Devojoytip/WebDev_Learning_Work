        If you ask any seasoned developer for their best advice on improving your skills, almost everyone will tell you
        to write code every single day. While the advice might sound obvious (and therefore not very useful) the simple
        truth is that it works.

        Working on open-source projects from places like GitHub helps you immerse yourself in code. You can choose to
        fork an existing project and create your iteration of it. You can also contribute to an existing project by
        helping the project reach its final stage or by fixing minor bugs to improve the projectâ€™s stability.

        No matter which option you choose, it inevitably leads to understanding your code better and it also exposes you
        to other peoples code which might show you a new way of doing things.

        On top of that, you get to collaborate with others on fun projects which help you get a second (or a third!)
        pair of eyes on your code. You will also learn to work better in a team and gain an invaluable learning
        opportunity.

        A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and innovations in
        the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development from informative
        blogs and videos.

        Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These meet-ups provide excellent opportunities to
        expand your network and get acquainted with talented people.

        While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must always
        remember two things while designing your platform  keep it simple and neat, and dont forget to create your
        signature style.
